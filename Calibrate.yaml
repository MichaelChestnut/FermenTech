# Please follow these steps to calibrate the FermenTech digital hydrometer
# A physical hydrometer is necessary to calibrate this sensor
# Insert the physical hydrometer into the brew
# Read the hydrometer scale at the lowest point of the liquid's surface
# Please change the value of the specific_gravity variable to the physical hydrometer reading to three decimal places (example: 1.000)

specific_gravity: 0
